        <p>Researcher and Project Manager</p>
      <p>As a LeafFree researcher, I gather information about how peer pressure affects teenagers and their use of marijuana. I use numbers and tools to find important patterns and trends in the data. I also compare recent information with older data to see how things have changed over time. In my role as a Project Manager, I plan out the steps we need to take, set goals, and make sure everyone is doing their tasks on time. I check how well we're doing, communicate a lot within the team, and help everyone work together smoothly. I make sure we finish our work on time and deal with any problems that might come up. I also work on the LeafFree app, making sure it matches what we learned from the research. I follow the app's progress from the start until it's ready for use, making sure it helps with the issue we're focusing on. This way, my job helps both in understanding the problem and creating a helpful solution through the app. </p>
