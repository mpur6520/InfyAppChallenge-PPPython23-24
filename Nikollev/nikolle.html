    <h1 class="myself">About this page:</h1>
    <center>
    <p> I am Nikolle Vizcaya, a current senior in Thomas Edison CTE High School. Education wise I am in the Gold Honor role, I'm a part of the Creative Design Team for the Edison Spark Literacy Magazine, and I am a member of the CTE program called programming and prototyping team. Outside of education I play Baskeball and Volleyball, create art, which is the major I applied to college for, I'm a part of Brain Power Leaders, I'm a part of Spark as a mentors for freshmans, and finally I am part of the Black Student Union E-board as the Secretary. I am a very hard worker in anything an everything I do. </p>
    <p> In my Programming and Prototyping class, I have learned a lot about Python/HTML and how to use it to create apps, just like LeafFree. This app is about helping teenagers with Mental Health issues as well as addiction with Marijuanna. A lot of teenagers mental health and addiction to addictive substance abuse are overlooked, and this app is made to make a community for them to not only help them, but also allow them to feel safe, heard, and people to rely on. </p>

    <center>
  <p> For this app, LeafFree my role has been the Complementer Finisher. I basically read over the resourcers one of my teammates gives me from their research and capture the important details for the app or assignment, and organize them into format that is best fit and understood. I'm basically the one that look's over work whether it's still in work progress, or completed I look over it and make sure it's all correctly done, it's in the right format, it's easy to understand, it's all in the right place, and it's all pleasing to eye. I grasp the details from our work and thrive it to the best of allof our ability. </p>
      <p> Outside of my main role I help out my teammates with anything that might be in need. We usually split the work evenly with eachother and then pick a dayb of the week to come together and cohesively combine all of our work, ideas, and concerns together. So, all of us end up doing everything, not just one thing. We all have main individual roles, but we all work together to make the app work and do it's best. We all research, we all design, we all give out ideas, we all code, but at the end of the day my role that stands out the most is my Complementer Finisher role and ability. </p>
