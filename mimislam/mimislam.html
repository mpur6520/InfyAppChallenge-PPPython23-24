      <h3>About me</h3>
      <h1>My name is Mim. My shop class is Programming & Prototyping. I'm a student at Thomas A. Edison Career and Technical Education High School, and I'm set to graduate in June 2025. I took a College Now class on Two-Dimensional Design. In school, I've been learning web design using CSS, HTML, and Javascript, and currently, I'm into programming with Python. I speak English and Bengali. I'm a co-founder of the Society of Film Appreciation, where we watch and talk about all kinds of movies. I've even tried my hand at making short films, which helped me with directing, scriptwriting, acting, and editing skills. In my free time, I volunteer and chat with senior citizens, which has improved my communication skills a lot. I've also worked with healthcare professionals to make a friendly space for senior citizens. I've got some certifications too! I completed a coding challenge in the Computer Science For All 2023 Hackathon, and I built a spaghetti noodle bridge and a tin foil boat for buoyancy. Aside from all that, I've been part of clubs like the Guitar Club, where I learned chords and played songs with the group. In the Asian Multicultural Club, I enjoyed cultural activities like listening to K-pop, trying snacks from Asian countries, and watching Korean dramas. I love being involved and learning new things!

          <h3>My role</h3>
          <h1>As an implementor in my group, my main job is to make things happen and put plans into action. I take the ideas and decisions from our team and turn them into real, tangible steps. This means organizing tasks, assigning responsibilities, and making sure everyone knows what they need to do. I'm like the person who takes the blueprint of a building and actually builds it. It's important for me to be organized, good at communicating, and able to solve problems that may come up during the process. I help the group move forward by turning our plans into reality.
