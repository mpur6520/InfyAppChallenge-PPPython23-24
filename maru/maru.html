      <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
      <p>Hi! My name is Maru and I'm a junior at Thomas A. Edison CTE High School! I'm a manager on my school's softball team, I mostly take photos, and a member of the National Honor Society. I'm in the class Programming & Prototyping and we do a lot of app development and planning, as well as a continuation of website development from last year. It's very nice to meet you! :) </p>

    <p>Iâ€™m the graphic designer of LeafFree, an innovative marijuana rehabilitation app designed to empower individuals on their journey towards a healthier lifestyle. My goal is to provide users with a supportive and visually-pleasing digital environment as they embark on their path to wellness. This means a lot of consideration on the colors, where everything is placed, and the overall user experience.</p>
