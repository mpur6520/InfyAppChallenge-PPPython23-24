# InfyApp Challenge ✏️  GROUP SITE




## Why Do we need a Group Website? 

We will focus on learning about how apps can be built to address a specific social issue (i.e. public health, climate change, food security, etc.).
## **Goals and Expectations** 
1. Students will determine two learning goals focused on the technology industry or knowledge to be developed through the completion of their app.
2. **Mentorship** – Students will prepare a written agenda outlining progress, challenges, and questions related to their project and learning goals before each meeting.
3. **Research-based Work** A component requiring the use of online resources and conversations with their mentor and other colleagues to inform their final product.
4. **Weekly Milestones** – All projects will have clear goals and deliverables for each week of the Infy App Challenge
5. **Peer Feedback** – Each week the PENCIL team will facilitate cohort meetings for students to hear from each other and give/get feedback on the aspect of the app project they are responsible for. 
6. **Final Deliverable** – Each student will create a working app to present within their issue." 

## Now onto the challenge.
